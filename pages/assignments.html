  <h3>Assignments</h3>
  <h4>Scholarly Website Presentation</h4>
  <p>
    Give a 10-minute presentation (5 minutes presentation + 5 minutes Q&A)
    analyzing a scholarly website related to your research interests. Explain
    how the website contributes to the goals of the author, subject matter,
    and/or discipline.
  </p>
  <h4>Personal CV or Wiki</h4>
  <p>
    Create a bare-bones website in the form of a CV or a personal wiki using
    HTML. The website should include at least two pages, as well as links to
    external sites. Potential information to include might be an about/bio page,
    a description of your research, a list of readings that influenced your
    work, etc.
  </p>
  <p class="dueDate">Due Feb 10</p>
  <h4>Updated Midterm Project</h4>
  <p>
    Update your midterm project with at least 3 new functionalities using
    JavaScript methods. To illustrate, these additions might look like
    dynamically displayed data, visibility toggles, or mouse interactions.
  </p>

  <h4>Midterm</h4>
  <p>
    Make a static website using HTML and CSS that presents research on a topic
    related to your academic work. The website should incorporate design
    principles learned in class up until the due date. An exceptional website
    will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have a layout reflective of its wireframe</li>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <li>Meet web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) covered in class (i.e. alt text, color contrast, text size)</li>
    <li>Be responsive, adapting to at least 2 screen sizes fluidly</li>
    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <li>Make use of color, typography, and composition to create a visual style</li>
    <li>Include semantic HTML and CSS classes/ids</li>
    <li>Feature relevant content</li>
    <li>Feature functional internal/external links</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Documentation of your process will factor into the assessment of this
    project, in addition to the resulting website. Documentation will comprise a
    <b>wireframe</b>, <b>a brief write-up</b>, and
    <b>a 10-minute presentation</b>. The write-up should be no less than 500
    words and cover 1) your goals for the website, 2) 1-2 design choices you
    made and the reasoning behind them, and 3) 1-2 technical challenges you
    solved in the process. The presentation should walk the class through your
    final website and development process. You may rely on your write-up to
    guide the presentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Source code and documentation should be uploaded to its own GitHub
    repository. The write-up can go in the README.md file. You can link your
    wireframe as a link online or as an image file in the README.md.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep in mind you will be asked to update your midterm project with basic
    functionality using JavaScript a few weeks following the deadline, so save
    any ideas that come up during the process about how to make your site more
    interactive.
  </p>
  <p class="dueDate">Due Mar 13</p>
  <h4>Final</h4>
  <p>
    For the final, you may choose one of two directions: 1) build on your
    midterm project with significant functionality and content, or 2) create a
    new website presenting one of your current or past research projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Projects will be assessed according to their level of completion, as
    measured by their content, design, and functionality. While the baseline
    expectation is that your site is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you
    are welcome to explore JavaScript libraries not covered in the class, or to
    build your website on a CMS platform/website builder. If your final project
    stack requires you to undertake significant independent learning in
    programming, I will be more lenient with the project’s definition of
    completion. If you opt for a CMS platform/website builder, I will expect a
    higher degree of completion than a hand-coded site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similar to the midterm, written documentation of your process will factor
    into project assessment. For the final, this will include a proposal,
    wireframe, write-up, and brief presentation. The write-up should include the
    following: 1) a technical challenge you solved during the process, 2) a
    feature you designed with accessibility, longevity, and/or sustainability in
    mind, and 3) how you would build on the work if given more time.
